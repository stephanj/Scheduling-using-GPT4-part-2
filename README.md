# Scheduling using GPT4 (Part Two)

In the second part of my project titled ["Scheduling using GPT-4"](https://github.com/stephanj/Scheduling-using-GPT4) I took a different approach to address the scalability issue I encountered in the previous part. 
Instead of relying on ChatGPT to directly generate a conference schedule, I asked it to assist me in developing a Python application capable of scheduling talks.

## A totally different approach

Initially, ChatGPT generated a basic Python app, and I further enhanced it by incorporating additional constraints to improve its functionality. 
This modified application allowed for more efficient scheduling considering factors such as talk duration, tracks, and room availability.

To explore alternative solutions, I also requested ChatGPT to create a Python app utilizing Google SAT's resolver and even a Java app utilizing OptaPlanner. These different approaches demonstrated the potential for developing a "feasible" application that aligns with my scheduling requirements.
